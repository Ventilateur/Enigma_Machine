# Enigma_Machine
My very first program in Java: <br />
A simple simulation of the well-known cipher machine used by the Germany during the WWII <br />
First, enter 3 letters of wheels' position + 3 letters of their notchs' position + 1 letter of reflextor type <br />
Then enter your message, it will be encrypted and decrypted by the rule of the standard Enigma machine <br/>
